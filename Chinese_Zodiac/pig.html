			<h3>Basic Character</h3>
			<br/>
			
			<p>
				Someone born under the sign of the pig tend to be a gentle person all around. With a strong interior grasp of their life and
				the people around them, they are able to spend much time both alone and in the company of others. Sometimes this can cause them
				to feel a little overwhelmed, as they might struggle to separate their thoughts from their immediate experience, but overall it 
				is a strength that allows them to entertain leadership positions if they put the time and effort in.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Pigs tend to enjoy interacting with others and taking advantage of what interpersonal relationships can offer them. They understand 
				how to converse with ease, even when they are sometimes feeling worn out or a little awkward inside, and they have an empathetic streak 
				which tends to endear them to others. While their life will have its own series of bumps and troubles, the Pig will generally have one
				of the more satisfying experiences in life. Should they ever feel they are drifting away from the life they would like to lead then,
				they simply have to refocus their efforts and go after whatever it is that they believe will make them happy. For without this focused
				effort, it may take much longer to achieve that sort of guiding revelation.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Personality</h3>
			
			<p>
				In their interactions with others, Pigs are people who will usually try to take a leadership position. Guiding the conversation one way
				or another, this will tend to satisfy others when they first get to know a Pig, as it eliminates awkward gaps that can make it hard to 
				speak freely. As they get to know someone more, however, a Pig's urge to lead can begin to reflect poorly in the eyes of their peers, and 
				as such it is important to pay attention to the amount that they are speaking versus the amount that they are listening. For when a Pig 
				is willing to listen a little more, they are more apt to gain insight into not only the other person, but pieces of their own personality
				as well.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Career and Money</h3>
			
			<p>
				Due to their natural inclination towards leadership, Pig's tend to do well in positions where they are able to take charge of a group of 
				people or a project as a whole. Once achieved, a Pig will often obtain the respect of their subordinates, as the Pig treats them fairly 
				and makes sure to listen to what they have to say, even when a problem cannot be resolved. Due to this nature, they also are more apt to 
				succeed in industries where they must hold the attention of others and leave them with a good feeling about what they've seen; which could
				easily be anything from live performance to a public position with a business or corporation.
