			<h3>Basic Character</h3>
			<br/>
			
			<p>
				The sign of the Dog emphasizes the importance of the self in those who are born under its sign. They are intelligent people
				who hold much of their thought process deep inside, and they are not always known for being able to share these thoughts freely
				with others. Part of this means that those born under the sign of the Dog live very rich inner lives, emphasizing the more 
				personal aspects of basic human life. They get lost in thought often, appreciate the options that they encounter every single day,
				and can often entertain themselves for hours on end with puzzles and other brain teasers.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Part of the strong inner lifestyle of the Dog, however, is a relatively restrained outer lifestyle. More apt to live a serious and 
				careful existence, a Dog is someone who will get the job done but rarely go beyond the scope of what it asked of them. This is because
				to them, there are more important things to do than spending their time trying to impress others, and they would rather enjoy what 
				they choose to do than sacrifice their freedom for a little monetary gain. Thus, a Dog is a person in charge of their own path, who while
				they will encounter resistance from time to time will generally hold true to the morals and the lifestyle that seems best to them.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Personality</h3>
			
			<p>
				As an inward focused being, the Dog may take a while to adjust to the social cues and requirements of conversation and interpersonal relationships.
				One must look past some of the more surface items and try to identify the important ideas that lie within a person. For a Dog will rarely gain much 
				satisfaction from simple conversation, but would rather entertain deeper problems. Should they manage to engage another person in discussions of this
				sort then, they will feel quite fulfilled and will often impress the other with their opinions and views. Should they not, however, then they will often
				end the conversation with a vague sense of a missed opportunity or an unrewarded effort.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Career and Money</h3>
			
			<p>
				As they are someone for whom problems and puzzles hold a strong attraction, those born under the sign of the Dog tend to thrive in the more 
				mathematical or specialized fields. Craftsmen, engineers, and others paths that require work with their hands and mind at the same time will
				take full advantage of Dog's capabilities. As someone with a natural inclination to focus on one thing at a time, however, the Dog can 
				sometimes lose track of their financial situation in favor of other interests. Luckily, this is something that they can resolve with a little
				resolution, as long as the make a point to look after their finances more regularly.
