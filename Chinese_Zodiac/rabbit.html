			<h3>Basic Character</h3>
			<br/>
			
			<p>
				The person born under the sign of the Rabbit has a tendency to be very easygoing with others, offering kind advice when
				it is needed but never forcing their ideas onto others. While their nature is easy, however, it is certainly not disorderly.
				Rabbits are calmest when they know what they are doing, and even in the face of chaos a Rabbit can hold steady as long as they
				have a plan. As such, they often occupy positions in life where they are in charge of day to day operations, ensuring that projects
				go smoothly and plans go off without a hitch.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Rabbits are also people who have a strong inner compass guiding their emotions. If they feel happy then they are apt to believe that 
				everything is going well in their life, rather than to question what is wrong. While when they feel sad they do not wait for it to pass,
				but act upon it in an attempt to right the perceived wrong. The only downside of which is that the Rabbit cannot just float pass certain 
				thoughts or feelings, but will always stress and worry over exactly what they mean, when sometimes they are nothing more than the whims 
				of a moment.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Personality</h3>
			
			<p>
				Those born under the sign of the Rabbit are often very skilled at making friends and making other happy. The feel happy and complete when 
				they are able to provide someone with a meaningful interaction, and as a result people will often stop to chat with Rabbits for no particular
				reason. Rabbits are also very good at reading a situation and figuring out how they should act around a person, helping to avoid conflict 
				whenever possible. As a result, most people receive the Rabbit with open arms and kind words, providing the Rabbit with a deep sense of satisfaction
				concerning their role in their professional or personal community.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Career and Money</h3>
			
			<p>
				In an effort to please, both themselves and other, the Rabbit is prone to issues with money. Though they have the ability to grow rich, they often prefer
				to spend time with their friends then work late and sacrifice their social life. Though this does not stop a Rabbit from wanting to have more than they do, 
				as they might sometimes struggle to accept their place in the world. On the whole, however, the Rabbit remains happy with life even when they struggle in 
				their career, pushing through the tougher times and flourishing in the company of the friends and loved ones.
