Challenges:

The most difficult challenges that we faced during this assignment was 

1. the amount of time required to stay after school to finish this project
2. the limited skill that we have 
3. had to do quit a bit a research when we don't understand how to code something
4. always have to transfer file through emails when is an update
5.. most importantly, the difficulty of collaborating without physically seeing each other.
