			<h3>Basic Character</h3>
			<br/>
			
			<p>
				Those born under the sign of the Dragon truly come to embody that fantastical creature, living their lives in the extremities of good 
				and bad. As such, they are prone to experience great growth and crushing tragedy at numerous points throughout their life. As trying as
				these intense periods can be for them, however, it also provides Dragons with an enlightened view of the world and the way that everything
				works. Which in turn transforms a Dragon into a being of strong morals and justice, unable to endure deceit but also incapable of avoiding
				the deceit of others.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As a result, Dragons can struggle for periods of their lives with a loss of faith. Questioning what their purpose is, they sometime must wander
				for a while and endure trials to rediscover their being. By the end of it all, however, a Dragon remains strong and will be able to survive 
				whatever life throws its way. In light of all their struggles, however, Dragons are also blessed with the greatest capacity for love of all the 
				twelve signs. A blessing which allows them to accomplish great deeds as a member of a team, and to share their lives with friends and family alike.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Personality</h3>
			
			<p>
				A Dragon's personality often seeks out other people when it needs to work through its own dilemmas. In this way, their interpersonal relationships serve
				a very important function, and they are often quite adamant about the need to spend time with their friends and family. As a result of this compulsion, however,
				they occasionally don't leave any time for solitary reflection, and can become agitated or upset. It is usually evident when this is happened though, and anyone
				familiar with them will forgive those rare occasions. Plus, after a little rest, a Dragon once again makes a strong conversationalist and a committed friend.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Career and Money</h3>
			
			<p>
				Committed to the concept that hard work pays off, Dragons have a predisposition to work themselves too hard, sometimes to the point of exhaustion. At which point 
				their health begins to suffer and they will struggle to accomplish even the simplest of tasks. As a result, Dragons often benefit from compassionate friends who 
				can tell when someone is working themselves too hard. With the right balance of work and relaxation, however, a Dragon will experience at least a moderate level
				of success in their life. And while money may pass through their fingers a little too fluidly at times, they will always retain the means to survive, and the 
				perseverance to never give up.
