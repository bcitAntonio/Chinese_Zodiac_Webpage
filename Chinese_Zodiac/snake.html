			<h3>Basic Character</h3>
			<br/>
			
			<p>
				Those born under the sign of the Snake place a lot of value on their own experiences. They learn from their own mistakes, 
				and they are quite adept at identifying the motivations of others. Because of this, Snakes are people who are rarely ever 
				deceived or taken advantage of without their knowledge. Sometimes they come off as a but suspicious, but usually they don't
				make a point of expressing their distrust. Rather, they simply choose to live their life according to their own plan and their
				own standards, enduring whatever comes their way with a stoic determination.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				One of the toughest things for someone born a Snake to deal with is the time they are forced to be alone. Communities help them to 
				feel complete, but as more people begin to surround them it becomes harder to monitor the situation and protect their own interests.
				As such, Snakes will often come and go in relationships, needing some time on their own in order to recoup their energy and refocus 
				their thoughts. When allowed such time without judgment, however, Snakes prove to be interesting friends; easily passing a night away
				in pleasant conversation with whoever is willing to sit down and join them.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Personality</h3>
			
			<p>
				A person born under the Snake sign is someone who likes to be in control of their own path. As a result, they tend to seek out the 
				leadership positions, both in their personal and their professional interactions. For most this is alright, as the Snake is a good 
				conversationalist when they put their mind to the task, although some of the more aggressive signs can misconstrue the Snakes actions. 
				Their main struggle, though, is with issue of trust. For while it is easy enough to speak casually with others for a few minutes at a 
				time, long and detailed conversations take on a much more difficult aspect.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Career and Money</h3>
			
			<p>
				Snakes are people who tend to excel in a certain job or position, and more often than not they will remain in one place for a number of 
				years. Part of their reason for doing this is comfort, as the longer they remain the more they can gauge those around them. While another
				part is their reasonable lifestyle, where money is not too much of an issue and they can successfully care for themselves. Should a change
				become necessary, however, Snakes can adapt enough to survive, safe in the knowledge that they will eventually settle into a comfortable
				routine again.
