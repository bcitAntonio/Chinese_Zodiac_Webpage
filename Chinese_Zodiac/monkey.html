			<h3>Basic Character</h3>
			<br/>
			
			<p>
				Those born under the sign of the Monkey are likely to view life as a series of quick events. Moving from one experience to the other,
				then, is not so much about the things that they are doing as the feelings that such moves evoke. If something is exciting, then they 
				are likely to act upon it and see what comes their way. Which can bring moments of great achievement as well as times of loss and 
				learning. What the Monkey represents then is a younger way of life, in which action, loss, and education all have an important role to play.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As a person born under the sign of the Monkey continues to age, however, and transitions into the phases of adulthood, they must readdress 
				the lifestyle and choices that have guided them thus far. While this can be difficult, the momentum does not have to cease, but can simply
				be redirected towards other forms of endeavors, such as hobbies or new careers. For in this manner the Monkey can continue to expand their
				experiences, but do not risk the well being of the people that have begun to form their inner circle, such as friends of old or a partner 
				and family.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Personality</h3>
			
			<p>
				A Monkey is likely to experience a number of swings in their mood and temperament when they interact with other people. Happy and energetic 
				one moment can easily turn into exhausted and grumpy the next. For many people, however, this unpredictable nature has a certain appeal, a
				certain type of mystery. And often Monkeys can pick up on these cues and navigate any place or atmosphere with at least some degree of success.
				Which all comes together to make the Monkey one of the easiest type of people to get along with, and an entertaining companion with which to
				spend an hour, an evening, or even a lifetime.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Career and Money</h3>
			
			<p>
				While a Monkey's life can take a number of different directions, their career is best served when they choose one path and stick with it. 
				Should they jump around there as they do in other areas of their life, then they will be far more likely to make mistakes that could not only 
				hurt their own future, but hold back the progress of those around them too. Thus, it can be a bit difficult for those born under the sign of
				the Monkey to adjust to the different requirements of their career, but once they allow themselves to focus their observant nature will make
				great success something that is within their reach.
