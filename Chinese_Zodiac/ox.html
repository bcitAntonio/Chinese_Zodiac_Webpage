			<h3>Basic Character</h3>
			<br/>
			
			<p>
				The Ox is a person who will often find themselves in the same place or situation for longer periods than others. Whether 
				it is in a relationship, a job, or just a phase of their life, the Ox is built to both endure and succeed. Part of this 
				is that they will tend to favor those things that they are already familiar with. This allows them to make the most of what 
				they can do, and in many ways to eliminate the chaos from their own world that seems to control so many others. As someone who 
				holds out for what they want, the Ox is also someone for whom discipline is second nature. They can maintain a level of work and 
				a state of mind far beyond many of their peers, both in their personal and professional lives. It can be hard, however, to endure
				sudden changes in their life, at least for the first few days. As the Ox slowly refocuses their mind, though, they will soon return
				to a more stable and happy state. It simply takes them a little longer than others to figure out what is the best path for them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Though once they do, they are strong and determined. As someone who takes their time with change and must feel before they can act, 
				the Ox is prone to follow the same sort of pattern in all of their relationships. They are quick to be friendly with others, but slow
				to transition into a deeper relationship. Some signs struggle as a result of this to get to know the Ox, though it is never impossible
				to break through that initial barrier. For those born under the sign of the Ox care feel for others with great force. Should if a partner
				can be patient and allow an Ox the time they need to adjust, the end result will be a relationship that will stand up to all the tests of time.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Personality</h3>
			
			<p> 
				While the Ox is slow to let others in, it is because they look to protect those that surround them. This makes them wonderful friends but 
				difficult acquaintances, as the transition from one to the other is not as fluid as it may be with other people. Once a person takes the time 
				to know an Ox, however, they will quickly find them a firm foundation on which to build a lasting relationship. For they are not there to judge 
				one way or another, but simply to support, sustain, and find comfort in the company of their friends and family.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Career and Money</h3>
			
			<p>
				The Ox is a person who will always work best when they are in a situation where they can apply themselves for a long period of time. Short-term 
				positions and project will make them uncomfortable, and as such they sometimes have trouble advancing through the first phases of their careers. 
				Once that period is over, however, an Ox will be perfect in any role that requires a deep and narrow field of knowledge. So while they don't tend
				to end up in managerial positions, those born under the sign of the Ox will eventually do well in their field of choice.
