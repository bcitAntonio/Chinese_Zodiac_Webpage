			<h3>Basic Character</h3>
			<br/>
			
			<p>
				The Rooster is an animal guided by its instinct, welcoming the morning sun for no other reason that it just feels right. 
				Similarly, those born under the sign of the Rooster will often find success when they allow themselves to be led by their
				instinct. This way compromise is swift, respect is steadily gained, and the overall pace of their life is one in which they 
				continue to achieve rather than dwell or worry. But for those under the sign of the Rooster, however, this beneficial way of
				life is not something that comes to them without effort. Rather, it is the result of holding off a different type of urge, 
				the urge to overthink.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When a Roosters allow themselves to overthink a situation, they can get caught on the details and sometimes lose sight of the 
				larger picture. The result being that decisions do not come as easily as they might, and their life will not progress at the 
				speed that it is really capable of going. With a little trust, and the ability to just commit, however, a Rooster can work to 
				overcome these issue. Though while they tend to see better results when they go with their gut reaction, the worst case is merely
				slow and steady, rather than anything worrisome.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Personality</h3>
			
			<p>
				Those born under the Rooster's sign find their relationships tend towards the jovial, with natural conversation and humorous mirth 
				flowing forth freely when they are able to relax. People are fond of Roosters as well in many social situations, as they are easy to
				speak with and are quick to agree to the ideas of the person they are with. For this to not seem like acquiescence, however, the 
				Rooster does need to make a point to differentiate cowardice and an open mind. For while both may produce the same result, the manner
				in which Roosters hold themselves will often speak volumes to their innermost character.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Career and Money</h3>
			
			<p>
				The Rooster excels in certain areas of their career, following instructions and making sure that their supervisors and bosses are always 
				content with the work that they are doing. As such it is not too hard for a Rooster to slowly climb the ranks in a business, though they
				will often be limited by the extent to which they struggle to make decisions on their own. If they can overcome this then those above them
				will see fit to trust them with more and more responsibility, while if cannot they will eventually level out at a point where they effect 
				some decent changes, but do not get to make any of the real decisions. But in either case they have the capability to provide for themselves
				on a long-term basis, and money will only be an issue for Roosters until they can find the motivation to push forward.
