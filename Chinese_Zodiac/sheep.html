			<h3>Basic Character</h3>
			<br/>
			
			<p>
				The sign of the Sheep produces a person who is not overly fond of sudden changes or impulsive decisions. Rather, the tend 
				towards the opposite end of the spectrum, finding comfort in both repetition and well-laid plans. Luckily for them, they
				have a natural inclination towards this type of work and are quite skilled at pulling together actions and events in a manner
				that flows naturally. Which allows both Sheep and anyone with them to enjoy a smooth and unhindered ride over life's many tiny bumps.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As much as the Sheep can improve a person's life, however, they are also protective about who they let into their inner circle. Not 
				just anyone can get to know someone born under the sign of the Sheep. Rather, they must prove themselves steadily over time, through 
				kind gestures and loving support, until the Sheep finally see that they are someone who can be trusted. Otherwise people are often 
				left viewing things at a distance, not quite knowing why they feel distant from the Sheep, but feeling it strongly all the same. It is
				the Sheep's choice then to weigh their two main paths, between a safe lifestyle with few close friends, or a much more social way of 
				life with its own inherent risks.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Personality</h3>
			
			<p>
				Due to the sensitive nature of the Sheep for most of their life, they can struggle to open up to others and form new friendships. Their 
				conversation is pleasant, nonetheless, and many people find they enjoy their initial time with those born under the sign of the Sheep, 
				but unless that person can compose the courage from within, the friendship cannot progress further. For most Sheep then, there is a cool 
				struggle within their mind, where the loneliness of isolation is often at battle with the comfort and safety of the wall that they erect.
				But the path is never set for good, and each and every person a Sheep comes in contact with is given a fair chance.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Career and Money</h3>
			
			<p>
				Sheep is one of the more adept signs when it comes to their career, able to adapt and continue on with whatever they need to do. The only 
				thing they require for such measures is a motivation for doing so, such as a family to help support or a final goal at the end. And for many
				this final goal is a revered position among their peers and friends, such as comes from an accomplished title or a well-paying position. 
				They can be quite content, however, even without such ends, and will be able to systematically approach nearly anything that the worlds of
				business and money can throw their way.
