			<h3>Basic Character</h3>
			<br/>
			
			<p>
				Those born under the Rat sign often find that their thoughts and lifestyle hold steady over time, 
				and while changes do occur from time to time they are the result of careful decisions and deep thought. 
				With protection comes hindrance, however, and occasionally one's caution can cause them to miss a chance at 
				something, whether it is a new job, a new relationship, or simply a new experience. Whatever the case, though, 
				the Rat continues to hold strong in its den, interacting with the rest of the world on their own terms, and 
				holding onto a sense of peace that perseveres all trials and tribulations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Part of the Rat's defenses is a positive outlook on the events that comprise their life, from the celebration
				of growing up to the conflicting emotions of adulthood. While there may be times of deep sorrow, or unwelcomed 
				change, there is also much happiness and light in one's life as well. Where the Rat excels, then, is in seeing 
				past those initial phases and focusing on the possibilities of their future. This allows them to survive even 
				the most troublesome of times and to thrive once again in the lifestyle they have chosen for themselves. Embracing
				the peace when it comes and embodying the spirit of their community.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Personality</h3>
			
			<p>
				Quick to give advice and always willing to help, the Rat is a person who their peers will often turn to when they need 
				a little guidance. And while they are quick to provide a helpful word, they can sometimes come to doubt their own advice.
				The Rat is also someone who will stress over what other people think of them, and is likely to view the purpose of their 
				life as the sum of their relationships. As such, those of this sign will tend to feel comfortable and perform their best 
				when part of closely knit group; one where thoughts, emotions, and friendship are all readily exchanged, and communication is easy.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Career and Money</h3>
			
			<p>
				The Rat is someone whose career will tend towards the conservative. While they certainly find praise and are good at what they do, 
				it is the risk associated with change that tends to keep them where they are. Luckily for them, however, this has little bearing on 
				their sense of satisfaction. Life continues one, with or without change, and the Rat will go about their business and rest easily each
				not. For while there is little excitement to be found, this frees them up to explore other areas in their life, including their relationships
				with the people that surround them.
