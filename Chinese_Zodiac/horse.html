			<h3>Basic Character</h3>
			<br/>
			
			<p>
				Those born under the sign of the Horse are a flexible group of people. They tend to be stubborn when it comes their ideas,
				but they are also incredibly patient when it comes to hearing out what other people have to say. They favor straight forward,
				occasionally blunt conversation. And yet they generally avoid starting up any unnecessary trouble. This combination then makes
				those under the Horse sign a bit of a puzzle to the people around them. Though this certainly does not stop people from trying
				to figure them out.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In spite of some of their misgivings, Horses are also incredibly loyal friends and partners. Perhaps it is because first impressions
				have a lasting effect, or simply that they are inclined to do well by others. Whatever the case for an individual, however, they are
				consistently there when friends need a person to turn to or a shoulder to lean on. They are also quite capable of resolving conflicts,
				both their own and other people's. Altogether then, those born under the sign of the Horse are some of the most favored members of 
				society; and though they don't often aspire to greatness they tend to achieve a manner of it through the compliments and adoration 
				of their friends.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Personality</h3>
			
			<p>
				The Horse is a person who will take a lot away from a first impression, viewing others from the side and figuring out who they are and 
				what are their motivations. As such, when they finally come face to face with a person their opinion is usually set, and their attitude
				will often reflect their initial judgment. If they like a person they will be amiable, asking and answering questions freely. Should they
				dislike them, however, no amount of prompting can force a full conversation from them, as they'd much rather be somewhere else. And while 
				this can sometimes result in awkward interactions, it is also a great tool the Horse has to ensure that they only associate with those that
				they are a natural fit for their own personality.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Career and Money</h3>
			
			<p>
				Those born under the sign of the Horse are adept as saving money, even if they do not make a lot of it at any one time. A simple life with a
				few pleasures is all that is really necessary, and as such they tend to handle the money in any relationship. If a career seems to produce to
				much conflict or compromise, however, a Horse is likely to change it around in order to find a better match for their personality; even when 
				this change will have a significant effect on the other people and areas of their life.
