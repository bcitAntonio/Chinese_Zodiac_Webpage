			<h3> Chinese Zodiac Stories</h3>
			
			<p> 
				There are many legends and mythology related to Chinese 
				zodiac and there are various versions and stories popular
				in different regions. Why were there twelve animals in the
				zodiac calendar and how did the scheme order come from? 
				Here are the most well-know stories, as an important part of 
				Chinese zodiacal culture.
			</p>
			<br/>
			
			<h3> Order of the Animals </h3>
			
			<div id="yingyang" >
				<img src="Images/yingyang.png" alt= "Zodiac yingyang" >
			</div>
			
			<p>
				This is the most widespread legend about Chinese zodiac. 
				The Jade Emperor (The Emperor in Heaven in Chinese folklore) 
				ordered that animals would be designated as calendar signs 
				and the twelve that arrived first would be selected. At that 
				time, the cat and the rat were good friends and neighbors. 
				When they heard of this news, the cat said to the rat: 'We 
				should arrive early to sign up, but I usually get up late.'
				The rat then promised to awaken his friend and go together. 
				However, on the morning when he got up, he was too excited to
				recall his promise, and went directly to the gathering place. 
				On the way, he encountered the tiger, ox, horse, and other 
				animals that ran much faster.
			</p>

			<p>
				In order not to fall behind them, he thought up a good idea.
				He made the straightforward ox carry him on condition that he 
				sang for the ox. At last, the ox and him arrived first. The 
				ox was happy thinking that he would be the first sign of the 
				years, but the rat had already slid in front, and became the 
				first lucky animal of the Chinese zodiac. Meanwhile his neighbor
				the cat was too late so when it finally arrived, the selection 
				was over. That's why other animals appear behind the little rat 
				and why the cat hates the rat so much that every time they meet, 
				the cat will chase and kill it. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				About this simple story, there are different editions. Some say
				it was the Yellow Emperor who intended to select twelve guards. 
				It is also said that cat hope rat could get there early and sign
				up on behalf, but rat completely forgot it or do that intentionally. 
				Some say the animals were request to have a swimming race, or a 
				simple race. Elephant was said to participate in the race too,
				but run away finally because rat got into it trunk.
			</p>
			
			
			<h3>Number of Zodiac Animals' Toes </h3>
			
			<p> 
				Many famous scholars in history had their own interpretations 
				about this interesting topic.There was a scholar in the Song 
				Dynasty (960 - 1279) called Hong Xun explained his thought based 
				on Yin Yang Theory. Among the twelve animals - rat, ox, tiger, 
				rabbit,dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig 
				- rat, tiger, dragon, monkey and dog have five toes. Five is an 
				odd number which is thought to be in yang side (or positive). 
				Horse has one toe, also an odd number. Others animals have toes
				of even numbers which are thought to be yin, negative. Snake has 
				no toe but its tongue has two tips in even number. Ying and yang 
				animal signs were interlaced. There were scholars of the Ming 
				Dynasty (1368 - 1644) followed and developed this idea. 
			</p>
			<br/>
			
			<h3> Why Did Rat Come in the First Place? </h3>
			
			<p> 
				Beside the tricks that rat played in the first story,there 
				are other legends about its priority in those animals. In Chinese
				mythology about the origin of world, the universe was in dark 
				without form like an egg before the earth and heaven was separated.
				It was the rat that bit a crack and let the air in.He was the 
				hero to start the world. That was to say the importance of him. 
				Another saying goes along with the toes story mentioned above. 
				His forepaws have four toes and hindpaws have five toes, with 
				both odd and even numbers. For such a special creature among 
				the twelve animals,rat won the first place.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Legends seem to be strained interpretations because the 
				original intention had been lost over such a long history. 
				Chinese zodiac was related to the Yin Yang, Five Elements 
				theories and other traditional life concepts. Thus it promoted
				the development of Chinese zodiacal culture. After having fun 
				of reading these stories, we still have to know some facts: it 
				is reliable to believe the zodiac animals started for worship 
				of animals in old times and twelve most important animals in 
				ancient peopleâ€™s life in was selected to vividly represent the
				Twelve Earthly Branches (the duodecimal cycle in Chinese 
				calendar). Cat was absent in the name list because there was
				no cat  in China very long time ago.
