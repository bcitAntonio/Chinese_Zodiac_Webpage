			<h3>Basic Character</h3>
			<br/>
			
			<p>
				The Tiger's name says a lot about their character, with a hard interiority that holds up a wall to the outside world. 
				While the Tiger is incredibly strong and stable, however, they sometimes hold too much inside and can find it difficult
				to let their stress out. They tend to act without warning too, moving from one area to another in an attempt to either 
				distract themselves or seek out new experiences. More often than not, however, this is an exciting occurrence and something
				that their friends and family look forward to.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Within the Tiger lies so much more than a strong defense, and there is a love of adventure that guides their more personal interactions. 
				From setting out to discover new things to getting lost in their thoughts and dreams, the Tiger rarely ever shows exactly how they are 
				feeling or what they are thinking. Though the reason for this stems not from a sense of deceit, but pride in the trust and stability they
				inspire in others. Altogether then, the Tiger is a person who is capable of a impressive feats from time to time, as long as they keep a 
				mindful view of how others view their actions.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Personality</h3>
			
			<p>
				In their relationships with other people, those born under the sign of the Tiger are likely to seek out others' respect through hard work 
				and a stable persona. This makes them adept at meeting new people, and often others will view a Tiger with a high-level of esteem. Part of 
				this persona, however, requires the Tiger to put in long hours and to steel themselves in front of others, which can occasionally make them
				seem almost inhuman. For finding the balance between disciplined trust and whimsical passion can be quite difficult at times for the Tiger,
				such as when emotions run high.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Career and Money</h3>
				
			<p>
					It is in the Tiger's nature to seek out opportunities wherever they can in an attempt to improve their abilities and hone their profession.
					This often means that they emphasize their appearance more than others, carefully crafting their looks to match their situation. It also 
					means that titles and respect are very important to a Tiger, and they will often do best in smaller communities where they can occupy a 
					much more involved position than they might in a large corporation. That being said, a Tiger will generally succeed wherever they are, as 
					long as they can achieve a balance between their personal and professional lives.
